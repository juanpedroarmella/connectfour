# Connect Four

It's a strategy game where two players take turns dropping colored discs into a vertical board with 6 rows and 7 columns. The objective is to connect four discs of the same color in a straight line, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally, before the other player does.

**Clarification:** This project is a modification of [EntregablePractico2](https://github.com/NahuFalconaro/Interfaces/tree/master/EntregablePractico2), on which I collaborated, with the aim of deploying it online and showcasing it on my portfolio.

This is a university project carried out in 2020 for the course "User Interfaces and Interaction" at UNICEN (Tandil, Argentina).
